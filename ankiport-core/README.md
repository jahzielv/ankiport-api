# ankiport

## Want to level up your flashcard game from Quizlet to Anki?
Anki offers tons of features that are either non-existent or not free in Quizlet.
Images, sounds, unlimited formatting options (including LaTeX for pain-free math symbols!),
and many more features are available out of the box with Anki. When I discovered Anki's
impressive feature set, my only regret from switching was that I couldn't move my
Quizlet decks over to Anki without a lot of hassle. Then I decided to write ankiport.
